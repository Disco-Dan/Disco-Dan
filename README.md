- 👋 Hi, I’m @Disco-Dan
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain and smart contracts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects written in Haskell
- 📫 How to reach me disco.0.dan@gmail.com
- A long time ago (think 6502, 8086, DEC PDP-11) I was a software engineer writing assembler for control systems.  Circumstances changed and I'm currently working as a Heating Engineer and Plumber. I've decided to return to my first love - programming. Any Haskell projects out there looking for help, give me a shout.
